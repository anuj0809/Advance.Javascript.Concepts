/*

Statically Typed: I have to declare the varibles explicitly to use them 
Dynamically Typed Languages : type checking is done using run time 

statically : int x=100
dynamically: var x=500


Holy war between which one is better ampng two ?

statically 

Pros:
1)They are self documented : helps in production level code as well
2) IdE's and text editors , helps for this 
3) Less bugs in production


Cons:
1)Code becomes harder to read
2)Slower developement process
